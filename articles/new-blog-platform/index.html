        <section><p>I&apos;m one of those bloggers that change their blog platform more often than is really required. I&apos;m also one of the bloggers that don&apos;t blog very often - and when I do, the posts usually start with how I&apos;m going to do it more often. This time, however, I&apos;ll just talk about what I&apos;m using now and why.

<p>When I switched to my previous platform, <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, I was excited to be using a static site generator. I agree with <a href="http://www.mickgardner.com/2012/12/an-introduction-to-static-site.html">Mick Gardner on the virtues of static site generators</a>. I also liked the ability to author them in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">markdown</a>, use <a href="http://github.com">source control</a> for the posts, and publish to <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. At the time I was really enjoying writing code in <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>.

</p>
<p>While I still think Ruby is a fantastic language, my infatuation with <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> overcame me a couple of years ago and it&apos;s been a beautiful affair ever since. Becuase I&apos;m not a regular blogger, there wasn&apos;t a rush to change platforms, despite the itch. During one of my scratching sessions, I ran across Boris Mann&apos;s post on <a href="http://blog.bmannconsulting.com/node-static-site-generators/">Node Based Static Site Generators</a>. I had known about <a href="http://github.com/creationix/wheat">Wheat</a> for a long time, and spent some time evaluating <a href="http://github.com/flatiron/blacksmith">Blacksmith</a>, which I found a little to incomplete for my needs, <a href="http://github.com/bevry/docpad">DocPad</a>, which I found to be heavier than I needed for my blog, but will likely use it for other things, and <a href="http://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith">Wintersmith</a>, which I decided on.

<p>Since my (only 3) existing posts were already in markdown, moving to the new generator was a snap. The only thing that was time consuming was applying the new design, which I wanted anyway. It&apos;s not done by the way, but I want to finish the upcoming easter egg before refining the design anymore.

</p>
<p>Thanks <a href="http://github.com/jnordberg">Johan</a>. I&apos;d like to eventually have a draft feature added. I&apos;ll send the pull request when I get around to it :)
